## Introduction

I recently delved into the world of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a protocol designed to improve the way we store and share content on the internet. In this journey, I discovered how IPFS operates compared to centralized servers, its cryptography in blockchain technology, and its potential to provide a decentralized solution.

## Understanding IPFS

### How IPFS Works

IPFS operates on a decentralized network where files are not stored on a central server but are distributed across a peer-to-peer network. Each file is given a unique hash, and retrieving the file involves querying the network for nodes that have that specific hash. Files on IPFS have a hash that changes if the file has been tampered with, providing a mechanism to prevent and spot malicious data.

This diagram shows the decentralized nature of IPFS and how files are distributed across nodes in the network. Each node contains a unique hash, ensuring data integrity and preventing a single point of failure.

### Comparison with Centralized Systems

Let's compare IPFS with traditional centralized systems:

| Aspect                    | Centralized                | IPFS                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Storage**               | Central Servers with Nodes | Peer-to-Peer Network      |
| **Reliability**           | Redundant Nodes            | Redundancy and Resilience |
| **Censorship Resistance** | Vulnerable                 | Resistant and Robust      |

Centralized servers do use nodes to decrease a single point of failure, but IPFS takes it a step further by decentralizing the entire network.

### IPFS in Cryptography and Blockchain Technology

IPFS integrates with blockchain technology, providing secure and transparent file storage. The cryptographic hashes used in IPFS ensure data integrity and authentication. Comparatively, HTTP 2.0 lacks this built-in security layer.

## Comparing HTTP 2.0 and IPFS Links

Let's break down conventional HTTP 2.0 links and an example link from IPFS:

**HTTP 2.0 Link:**

```plaintext
https://www.example.com/path/to/content
```

**IPFS Link:**

```plaintext
ipfs://QmXyZaBc123/example/content
```

Components breakdown:

- **Protocol:** HTTP vs IPFS
- **Address:** Domain in HTTP, Hash in IPFS
- **Path:** Traditional path in HTTP, Content hash in IPFS

## IPFS and Censorship Resistance

In countries with strict censorship like China, IPFS offers a decentralized solution. Since the content is distributed across a peer-to-peer network, it becomes challenging for authorities to block access. Additionally, the cryptographic integrity checks make it harder to manipulate or inject malicious content.

## Privacy and Decentralization

One of the significant advantages of IPFS is privacy. With your data distributed across the network, ISPs find it challenging to track your activities compared to centralized systems. This decentralization contributes to a more private and secure online experience.

## Summary

IPFS is a protocol reshaping the internet. It's a decentralized, peer-to-peer file system that ensures data integrity, resiliency, and resistance. By using cryptographic hashes and blockchain integration, IPFS provides a secure and transparent way to share and store and share content.
