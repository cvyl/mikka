# Mikka's Blog

This is the repository for my personal blog built with Vue 3, Vite, and a minimalist design approach.
This blog is a place for me to share my thoughts, projects, and experiences.

## Credits

This project is inspired by and based on [nyac.at](https://github.com/clansty/nyac.at) by Clansty. I'm grateful for the original theming and design concepts which served as a foundation for this site. While I've made modifications to suit my personal style and needs, credit for the original design approach goes to Clansty.

## Development
